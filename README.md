# Websocket-provisioner

Provisioning hosts using a Websocket. 
The idea is to have a simple script like application that can later tell the device its specific setup instructions.


## Usage
### Running

* `make demo-start`

### Stopping

* `make demo-stop`

## Future ideas
* Adding the client to an ISO and then over Websocket set details and project etc.
* Add ESP32/8266 support.
